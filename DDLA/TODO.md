BLAS:

- [ ] Implement managed BLAS utils routines.(High)
- [ ] Optimize BLAS level3 routines for performance.
- [ ] Add better multi-threading support to BLAS routines.
- [ ] Document BLAS API and usage examples.(High)

High-level LA:

- [ ] Optimize SymmEVD and SVD routines.(High)
- [ ] Implement other utils routines, e.g. cond().
- [ ] Create tutorials for high-level LA functionalities.
- [ ] Implement D&C SymmEVD and SVD routines. (Hard)

MArray:

The MArray module is in a relatively early stage, and only the einsum method can be used, but the edge situation has not been fully considered. Our future plan is to focus on scientific computing and align with the numpy API.

Misc:

- [ ] More and more usage examples and benchmarks.
- [ ] Optimize the ufunc system to support chain calls.
- [ ] ......
